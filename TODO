Before release 1.0:
-------------------
- transposition tables
- 3-fold repetition
- contempt value for DRAWSCORE based on game phase (endgame = 0; other = -0.25)
  - return DRAWSCORE --> return contempt_draw();
  - contempt_draw() { if (endgame) return 0; else -0.25 for white, 0.25 for black.
- razoring
- static null move pruning (does it help? or much slower due to double NNUE?)
- futility pruning (e.g., Blunder)

- bug: when found a mating distance, search keeps deepening and slow.
  Should return almost immediately!
