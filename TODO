TODO

Before release 1.0:
-------------------
- read input (for 'stop' command)
- transposition tables
- 3-fold repetition
- razoring
- static null move pruning (does it help? or much slower due to double NNUE?)
- futility pruning (e.g., Blunder)

- bug: when found a mating distance, search keeps deepening and slow.
  Should return almost immediately!


Infinity wars:
--------------
- pondering
- lazy SMP
- static exchange evaluation (SEE) for ordering captures in qsearch()
