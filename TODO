TODO
====
- aspiration window
- time controls
- transposition tables
- 3-fold repetition
- razoring
- static null move pruning (does it help? or much slower due to double NNUE?)
- futility pruning (e.g., Blunder)

- bug: when found a mating distance, search keeps deepening and slow.
  Should return almost immediately!
